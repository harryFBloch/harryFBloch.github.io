After taking a few months off from coding to run a 3D printing company. I have decided to go down a different path, and learn web development. I am really excited for this new adventure and all the optunities it will open up for me. 

So far we have been focusing on the basics of ruby and object oriented programing. Thankfully allot of my knowledge of Objective-c and swift was able to transfer over to ruby. Some of the changes where more difficult to get used to than others. For example in objective-c the convention is to use cammel casing for variable and method definitions, however in ruby you use snake case.  I found this to be a difficult transition to make but am slowly getting used to it. 

One thing that i have grown to really love about ruby is the class variables. Class variables in ruby make it very easy to to store data and pass that data to different parts of your program.  For example in objective-c or swift the easiest way to make data available is to create a singleton class. In ruby its much simpler because you can use a class varible to store all your instances of that class. 

I am very excited to get stared on the first project next week and see what i can do with it.
