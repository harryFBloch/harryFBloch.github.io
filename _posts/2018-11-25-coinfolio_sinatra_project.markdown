For my second project at Flatiron school we were challenged with creating a CRUD MVC app using the sinatra gem. I decided to further extend my first project from a CLI app into a web app. I created a simple cryptocurrency portfolio tracking app. That allows users to sign up and then add coins to their portfolio so you can see what is going on with all your coins in place. 

	My biggest challenges with this project was figuring out how to pass data from ruby to javascript, learning to use materialize, and lazy loading images on the coin index page. I was able to overcome these problems with help from stackoverflow.com, the materialize documentation, and the w3schools website.
